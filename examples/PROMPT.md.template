We are [PROJECT GOAL - e.g., "building and testing a dashboard application"].

**CRITICAL: AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION ENABLED**
- You have FULL permissions to execute ALL bash commands autonomously
- Run curl, npm, tests - everything yourself
- DO NOT ask for permission - just execute
- DO NOT say "manual verification required" - execute and verify yourself

**IMPORTANT: ALL SERVICES ARE ALREADY RUNNING**
- Port 8000: [Your Service Name]
- Port 3000: [Your Frontend, if applicable]

**DO NOT START SERVICES** - they are already running. If you need to restart a service, first kill the existing process:
```bash
lsof -ti :<PORT> | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null
```

**First read activity.md to see what was recently accomplished.**

**Then open plan.md and choose the SINGLE highest priority task where "passes" is false.**

**For TESTING tasks (category: "testing"):**
1. Run the test command yourself
2. Verify the result
3. Take screenshots if using Playwright MCP
4. Document what passed/failed in activity.md
5. Update that task's "passes" field from false to true
6. Make one git commit with clear message

**For FEATURE tasks (category: "feature"):**
1. Read the task description and all steps
2. **EXECUTE** all commands yourself (create files, run npm, install deps)
3. **VERIFY** everything works before moving on
4. Append a dated progress entry to activity.md
5. Update that task's "passes" field in plan.md from false to true
6. Make one git commit for that task only

**ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK PER ITERATION.**

**DO NOT run git init, do not change git remotes, and do not push.**

When ALL tasks in plan.md have "passes": true, output exactly:

<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
